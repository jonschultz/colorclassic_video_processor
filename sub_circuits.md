Horizontal Section
#
The high-level function of the horizontal section is to take the composite sync signal provided on the Color Classic analog board ("AB"), extract a horizontal sync signal, and then use that to generate the horizontal deflection pulse within the required range of duty cycle. The horizontal deflection pulse is used to ultimately pulse the horizontal output transistor on the AB.
